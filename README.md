These are my solutions to the problems of the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) website.

This is a personal challenge, that is, it will not always have the best solution, but a solution that has passed through time. :D

Every day I will solve 5 problems. Each problem will be in a different category (as long as possible) and I will always take the problem from the top of the list that I have not yet solved.
